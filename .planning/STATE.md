# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-09)

**Core value:** Convert the manuscript from a descriptive pleiotropy catalog into a mechanistically resolved cross-ancestry framework with three integrated analytical spines (coloc.susie + QTL coloc, bidirectional MR, matched-N cross-ancestry + selection scans).
**Current focus:** Phase 00 — data-access-infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 00 (data-access-infrastructure) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 4
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in .planning/DECISIONS.md (8 decisions as of 2026-04-09).
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Scope tier: T1 spine first, T2/T3 gated at checkpoints
- Data access: 6 of 8 sources are open-access sumstats; All of Us Controlled Tier already credentialed (sumstats exportable, individual-level stays on Workbench)
- UK Biobank main DUA deferred to not-needed-unless status
- [Phase 00]: Removed hardcoded rscript_bin; fixed Snakemake version pin from 8.* to 7.32.4; used =version conda format for HPC portability
- [Phase 00]: Refactored rules delegate to legacy scripts rather than duplicating logic; all rscript_bin refs removed
- [Phase 00]: DIAMANTE T2D dedup audit: position-level dedup is methodologically sound; 167K count unverifiable from existing artifacts
- [Phase 00]: KCNJ11 confirmed absent from seed regions (only in coloc results with 6 variants < 50 threshold)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
